A slightly tweaked version of [timh's Bish Bash Bosh script](https://community.wanikani.com/t/bishbashbosh-cram-apprentice-1-items-and-recent-failures/37388).

You can try out the new version [here](https://storyyeller.github.io/bishbashonce/bbo.html).

Changes compared to timh's version:

* Only one correct answer needed instead of two (hence the name Bish Bash _Once_)
* Option to cram non-gurued radicals and kanji to help with rapid leveling
* "Ancient gurus" option has more variation
